# 3.0 Release Notes (preview)

3.0 preview versions of the Npgsql Entity Framework Core provider are available on nuget. These work with the corresponding preview versions of [Entity Framework Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-3.0), and bring new Npgsql features in addition to the general EF Core changes.

> [!CAUTION]
> Use these versions with care and do not deploy to production without thorough testing. Read the breaking changes section below.

The full list of issues for this release is [available here](https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL/milestone/20?closed=1).

## New Features

Aside from general EF Core features new in 3.0.0, the Npgsql EF Core provider contains the following major new features:

* PostgreSQL identity columns are now the default - see breaking changes below) ([#804](https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL/issues/804))
* Sequence options can now be managed on identity columns ([#819](https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL/issues/819))
* Support has been added for the upcoming [PostgreSQL 12 generated columns feature](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/ddl-generated-columns.html) ([#939](https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL/issues/939)).
* Index sort options (ascending/descending, null sort order...) can now be specified ([#326](https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL/issues/326)).
* Indexes can now be created concurrently ([#967](https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL/issues/967))
* Views are now reverse-engineered ([#878](https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL/issues/878)).

## Breaking changes

> [!CAUTION]
> The default value generation strategy has changed from the older SERIAL columns to the newer IDENTITY columns.
>
> When producing a migration with 3.0, the Npgsql provider will attempt to automatically generate SQL to alter your tables and convert serial columns
> to identity ones. This is a sensitive, one-time migration operation that should be done with care, and carefully tested before deployment to production.
> You may also explicitly opt out of this change, more information is available in [the doc page about generated properties](../modeling/value-generation.md).
