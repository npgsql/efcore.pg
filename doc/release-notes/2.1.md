# 2.1 Release Notes

Version 2.1.0 of the Npgsql Entity Framework Core provider has been released and is available on nuget. This version works with version 2.1.0 of Entity Framework Core (LINK), and contains some new Npgsql features as well. 

## New Features

Aside from general EF Core features new in 2.1.0, the Npgsql provider contains the following major new features:

* Support PostgreSQL 10 IDENTITY columns as an alternative to SERIAL ([#253](https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL/issues/253)) - the provider will even seamlessly migrate your existing database. [See the docs for more info](http://www.npgsql.org/efcore/value-generation.html).
* PostgreSQL's built-in range types can now be mapped ([#63](https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL/issues/63)), head over to the [PostgreSQL docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/rangetypes.html) to find out more about range types. Note that user-defined range types are *not* supported, if you're interested let us know at [#329](https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL/issues/329).
* You can now use client certificate authentication and provide a server certificate validation callback ([#270](https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL/issues/270)). See [the doc for usage instructions](http://www.npgsql.org/efcore/misc.html#certificate-authentication).
* Support PostgreSQL 10 sequences with type `int` and `smallint` ([#301](https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL/issues/301)).
* Identifiers will only be quoted if needed ([#327](https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL/issues/327)), this should make the generated SQL much easier to read.
* You can now specify the [tablespace](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/manage-ag-tablespaces.html) when creating your databases ([#332](https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL/issues/332)).
* You can now use the PostgreSQL Full Text Search functions and operators from LINQ queries (except for ```array_to_tsquery```, which is not possible to implement currently due to Entity Framework Core limitations). ```NpgsqlTsQuery``` and ```NpgsqlTsVector``` are now fully supported property types that will create ```tsquery``` and ```tsvector``` columns. Full text search functions are implemented as extensions on ```DbFunctions``` and both full text types. Raw SQL migrations are still needed to create and drop update triggers however.

Here's the [full list of issues](https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL/milestone/8?closed=1). Please report any problems to https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL.

## Breaking changes

* The provider's classes used to be in the namespace `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore`. To promote better separation and prevent accidental provider use of internal EF Core classes, all provider classes have been moved to the Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL namespace, with the exception of some extensions (e.g. `UseNpgsql()`). If you've taken a reference on any provider classes you may need to add a `using` statement.
* If you're specifying index methods with `ForNpgsqlHasMethod()`, then you will have to fix migrations which generate those indices. In these migrations, you will find code such as `.Annotation("Npgsql:Npgsql:IndexMethod", "gin")`. You must remove the extra `Npgsql:`, leaving `.Annotation("Npgsql:IndexMethod", "gin")`.
* Specifying versions when specifying PostgreSQL extensions on your model is no longer supported - this was a very rarely-used feature which interfered with extension scaffolding.
* If you're still referencing the nuget package Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL.Design, please remove it - it's no longer needed or up to date.
