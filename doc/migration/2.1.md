# 2.1 Release Notes

Version 2.1.0 of the Npgsql Entity Framework Core provider has been released and is available on nuget. This version works with version 2.1.0 of Entity Framework Core (LINK), and contains some new Npgsql features as well. 

## New Features

Aside from general EF Core features new in 2.1.0, the Npgsql provider contains the following major new features:

* Support PostgreSQL 10 IDENTITY columns as an alternative to SERIAL ([#253](https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL/issues/253)) - the provider will even seamlessly migrate your existing database. [See the docs for more info](http://www.npgsql.org/efcore/value-generation.html).
* PostgreSQL's built-in range types can now be mapped ([#63](https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL/issues/63)), head over to the [PostgreSQL docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/rangetypes.html) to find out more about range types. Note that user-defined range types are *not* supported, if you're interested let us know at [#329](https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL/issues/329).
* You can now use client certificate authentication and provide a server certificate validation callback ([#270](https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL/issues/270)). See [the doc for usage instructions](http://www.npgsql.org/efcore/misc.html#certificate-authentication).
* Support PostgreSQL 10 sequences with type `int` and `smallint` ([#301](https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL/issues/301)).
* Identifiers will only be quoted if needed ([#327](https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL/issues/327)), this should make the generated SQL much easier to read.

Here's the [full list of issues](https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL/milestone/8?closed=1). Please report any problems to https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL.

## Upgrading from 1.x

* Previously an Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL.Design nuget package existed alongside the main package. Its contents have been merged into the main Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL and no new version has been released.
* Specifying versions when specifying PostgreSQL extensions on your model is no longer supported - this was a very rarely-used feature which interfered with extension scaffolding.
